# Instruction about how to use SCATS

The inputs of SCATS are aligned single-cell RNA-seq data in BAM format and a reference isoform annotation file (Ensembl/Refseq). User needs to specify `-task` to perform in each step:
```
SCATS.py -task <task>:

        refgene:   preprocess reference file

        group:   group alternative splicing exon

        count:   count informative reads from indexed BAM file

        gene:    estimate mean gene expression for each single cell condition

        das:    detect differential alternative splicing (DAS) for each exon group between conditions

        sum:    summarize DAS test results

```

## Step 1: Group exons based on reference annotation file
SCATS requires a reference annotation file `example.refFile` in following format:

Reference file in this format can be downloaded at [UCSC](https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTables?command=start) by selecting "all fields from selected table" in output format.

We preprocess `example.refFile` by using `python SCATS.py -task refgene`. An example is given below.
```
python SCATS.py -task refgene -ref example.refFile -out example.refgene
```
Next, the command for exon grouping is to run `python SCATS.py -task group`.
```
python SCATS.py -task group -refgene example.refgene -out example.gpinfo
```
`example.refgene` and `example.gpinfo` are two important calibrated annotation files for following steps.

## Step 2: Extract informative read count for each exon group from alignment file
SCATS requires a headerless `metafile` in this step to tell SCATS that how and where to find the aligment BAM files to extract cell-specific informative read count. BAM files have to be indexed. Here is an example of `metafile`
```

```
where <strong>1st</strong> column contains cell <strong>barcode/cell name</strong>, <strong>2nd</strong> column represents <strong>condition group</strong>, <strong>3rd</strong> column represents the <strong>location of BAM file</strong>. <strong>4th</strong> and <strong>5th</strong> columns represent the <strong>tag names of UMI barcode and cell barcode</strong> in BAM file. For example
```

```
where UMI barcode and cell barcode tag names are indicated by "UB" and "CB" in this BAM file.

The specific usage details are given below.
```
        USAGE:
        python SCATS.py -task count [count options] -meta <metafile> -refgene <refgene_file> -gpinfo <gpinfo_file>

        [count options]    type 'python SCATS.py -task count' to check two important count options.
        
          -umi  <yes/no> collect UMI count or not
        
          -onebam  <yes/no> whether all aligned reads are merged in one BAM files

        OUTPUT:
        
          count_*.sh    script files will be generated under directory `./tmp/count_script`.
```
where '-umi' and '-onebam' are two important options:
* `-umi yes -onebam -yes`: UMI and cell barcode tag names have to be specified in the <strong>4th</strong> and <strong>5th</strong> columns of `metafile`.
* `-umi yes -onebam -no`: only UMI barcode tag name is needed. It has to be specified in the <strong>4th</strong> column of `metafile`.
* `-umi no -onebam -yes`: only cell barcode tag name is needed. It has to be specified in the <strong>4th</strong> column of `metafile`.
* `-umi no -onebam -no`: no tag name is needed.

Outputs of `python SCATS.py -task count` are `count_*.sh` script files located at `./tmp/count_script`. User needs to run all of them to obtain informative read count for each single cell.

## Step 3: Quantify gene-level expression accounting for technical noises
In this step, user needs to give  `metafile` to SCATS and specify the number of cores to use for each pairwise comparison between conditions:
```
python SCATS.py -task gene -ncore 20 -meta metafile
```
Outputs of `python SCATS.py -task gene` are `gene_*.sh` script files located at `./tmp/gene_script`. User needs to run all of them to obtain accurate gene expression estimations for each cell condition group.

## Step 4: Detect differential alternative splicing (DAS) across cell conditions accounting for technical noises
In this step, user needs to give  `metafile` and `example.gpinfo` to SCATS and specify the number of cores to use for each pairwise comparison between conditions:
```
python SCATS.py -task das -ncore 20 -meta metafile -gpinfo example.gpinfo
```
Outputs of `python SCATS.py -task das` are `das_*.sh` script files located at `./tmp/das_script`. User needs to run all of them to obtain differential alternative splicing even at exon group level across cell conditions.

## Step 5: Summarize DAS test results
```
python SCATS.py -task sum -gpinfo example.gpinfo
```
